##OptiBrowser

If you run a PC with multiple browsers you may sometimes wish to start some links with say Firefox and others with Internet Explorer.

By default your OS will open all http:// links with the default browser.

By setting your default browser to OptiBrowser you can choose which browser the link should start in.


#Roadmap
Some ideas about where to go from here
* (Current Version) Basic 3-browser selection (Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome)
* Customisable browsers
* Auto-start link after x seconds
* Multi-platform
